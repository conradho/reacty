// Modules and Variables
// Sass code that doesn't cause Sass to actually output CSS.
// Things like mixin declarations, functions, and variables.
// base calls modules/_all.scss to get all these utility modules
@import "partials/base";

// Partials- the actual code. each file here will do a single
// import base to get access to my entire Sass environment
// (ie. the variables and the modules)
@import "partials/sticky-footer";
@import "partials/typography";
@import "partials/console-iframe";
@import "partials/console-toolbar";

// Third-party stuff not to be modified
// eg: bootstrap? which just acts on its own dom stuff
// and doesn't need to be imported in your scss
